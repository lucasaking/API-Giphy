Search for a funny gif using the search field. You can pick any topic (i.e... Cats or Basketball or Hilarious). It will be added to your GIF Canvas along with all the other GIFS you have generated. You can change the color gradient of the canvas for fun. It will randomly generate 3 seperate sets of x, y, z RGB numbers. The linear gradient will change by 3 colors everytime you click the button. You will see the Dancing Kirby Emojis also change their colors along with your canvas. Click the Clear Canvas button to remove all the gifs you have added to the Canvas.
